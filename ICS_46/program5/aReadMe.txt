All files but not hash_map.hpp/hash_set.hpp yet.
Use yours if you have written them. These two
files will be in the download available after
I release my solution to Programming Assignment #4.

The heap_adjustable_hash_priority_queue.hpp is a copy
of heap_priority_queue with a few small changes (mostly
the declaration of an update method and a lookup instance
variable). You need to update the standard heap_priority_queue
methods (and update) so that it efficiently implements the full
heap_adjustable_hash_priority_queue.
